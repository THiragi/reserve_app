That makes a good choice if you\u2019re building something new from scratch, but also when you\u2019re trying to integrate it into an existing application with lots of existing markup. The plugin comes bundled with a useful set of validation methods, including URL and email validation, while providing an API to write your own methods. All bundled methods come with default error messages in english and translations into 36 locales.".freeze
